# Technical Analytics App

This is an interactive web application hosted on Streamlit that performs statistical analysis on public equities. The user inputs any ticker symbol and timeframe. The app builds a linear regression parallel channel and calculates key metrics to evaluate investment performance.

"stocks-ml.py" is the main program. 

"stocks.py" is the same less the algo-trading strategy backtesting.
